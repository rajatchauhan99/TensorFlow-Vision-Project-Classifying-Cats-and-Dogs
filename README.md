# TensorFlow-Vision-Project-Classifying-Cats-and-Dogs


Key highlights of the project:

1. Dataset Exploration: Investigated the 'cats_vs_dogs' dataset using TensorFlow Datasets, comprising a substantial collection of cat and dog images.

2. Model Architecture: Crafted a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leveraging TensorFlow, featuring convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling, drop-outs and dense layers.

3. Data Preprocessing: Employed image preprocessing techniques to resize images, cast them to float32, and normalize pixel values to enhance model performance.

4. Training Pipeline: Developed an efficient training pipeline, meticulously splitting data into training and testing subsets, ensuring rigorous validation for model accuracy.

5. Performance Analysis: Evaluated and visualized training and validation metrics, showcasing the model's learning curve and validating its accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs.
